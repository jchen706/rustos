I think that libC choose these particular alignments because current system are 32 or 64 bytes. With malloc in 8 or 16 bytes alignment, we can align 4 indexes of 8 or 2 indices of 16 bytes in a 32 byte. Similar to the 64 bytes, 4 indices of 16 or 8 indices of 8. Therefore developer of other devices can easily manage backwards compatability and allow for device drivers and programs to run long term.
