Name mangling is need in Rust and C++ because user can call library functions in C which has different syntax, and Rust and C++ can't not access the variables within these functions. Therefore, no mangle allows for these namespace variables and properties to become visible within the Rust code which users can change. They also prevent file functions having same names to perform undefined behavior. File names of the same symbol names can have linking errors.
