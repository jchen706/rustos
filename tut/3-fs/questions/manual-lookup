To look this up, you get the root directory cluster, which opens into the directory. This is also the starting cluster. Here the VFAT calculates the start of the FAT which is the number of reserve sectors in our implementation. With the sectors per cluster , number of fats, and total logical sectors, we can calculate the beginning of the startign cluster for the directory. There, we can interate by reading the cluster chain of the directory starting at the root then to a. Here we can traverse the entries and name match them to b. Which same happens for c, travering the in directory of b and name match. The cluster values of the next directory or file is generate by the high and low cluster bits from the ebpb. To find the c file we search if the file is a directory or not.
