Rust split the responsibilites which protects the caller from double free and have references to null values. Returning proper align address can prevent the user from seg vaults in C. In addition, the user can have more time focus on application rather than memory management and debugging. For the allocator, the allocator would always know the next address is correctly and do not have to worry about overwriting a unintended value.
