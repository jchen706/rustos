Safe interfaces to end users has many benefits. It allows the user to follow Rust's mutability and borrow characteristics preventing data races and memory safety to the unsafe foundation. We could also wrap the the unsafe code into Rust wrappers or smart pointers to provide some characteristics of multiple mutable types and memory drop after going out of scope. We cannot have the same benefits in C. In C, there is no gurantee in C for memory safety or data races.
