I choose the 29 bins with 0 bin have the size of 0 to 2^3 byte. My allocator handels alignment by allocating the max of the layout size and layout alignment and that would be the size of the block. This cause massive internal fragment. Currenlty hangs on the Raspberry Pi and Qemu if it enters the File System Open. My design choise has massive internal fragmentation, but little external fragmentation. Since the bins are align to a power of 2. Request page sizes must fit into these defined size blocks. I am currently still trying to improve this implementation.
