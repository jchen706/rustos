If there is no event, means that the SEV or the SEVL instruction is not called yet to generate an event or a interrupt has not happened. Since events are external to the program, 
process going into waiting will have wait for an external event to occur to reenter the as a ready state for the process. This is correct behavior for waiting for an event, because
you will need an event to occur to resume process or else keep waiting.
