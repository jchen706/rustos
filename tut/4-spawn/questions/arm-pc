We can use MOV lr A. A is the address in immediate value.

We copy the address to lr which ret uses as the return address for the PC.

For the eret, we can use: mov x0  A
						  msr ELR_ELx x0


For the eret instruction, the PC is stored with the value held in the ELR_ELx, and PSTATE is restored by using the contents of SPSR_ELx. ELR_ELx and SPSR_ELx are at the Exception Level the exception is returning from.
