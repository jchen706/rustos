We can use virutal memory to allocate minimal memory used by the stack by have a process with a page or paging files. When more virtual memory is required, a DataAbort exeception is generated, the operating system add more virtual space to the process or more pages. We can get the virtual address of the DataAbort from the FAR_EL1 register and alloc more pages to the stack then so grow the stack size which will increase the bottom of the stack.
