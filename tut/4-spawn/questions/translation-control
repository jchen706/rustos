For the page table our design is using only two entries in the L2 Pagetable which means we only need 1 bit so the bit 29 on the virtual address is the index into the L2 Pagetable.
The TTBR select address will still be all 1's for the TTBR1 (user page table) and 0's for the TTBR0_EL1 for the kernel page table.


For the TTBR Select, our design will contain the unused bits from the L2 Pagetable translation which will be [63:30], and the L2 Page table index bit will be VA[29].
L3 Pagetable bits are unchange at [28:16]. 



So basically, the MMU now has to index into the TTBR Select with all 1's to make sure to take the TTBR1 pagetable address.
