Two queues, the ready queue will be check when scheduleing process in normal execution flow. The waiting queue will be used when a event triggers the scheduler to check the waiting queue to see if a process is ready and move that process to the ready queue and continue normal execution. I expect the average latency/ throughput to be better with less checks on processes that are waiting.
