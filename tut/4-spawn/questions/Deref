The compiler only knows how to dereference & references. Because KernalPageTable and UserPageTable are structs, the type cannot be dereference. The Deref traits allow for the UserPageTable and KernelPageTable to return reference to the inner data Pagetable by Deref coercion. This allows us to use the inner Pagetable implementation on the VMAP for example. The DerefMut allows the return Pagetable to be mutable when used as a mutable reference.
