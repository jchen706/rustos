Unmasking IRQ can happen during like having a higher priority interrupt occur and then second priority interrupt executes after. A emergency interrupt for instance like a phone ring happens even if the alarm is going off while reading through messages in an application. I think the first interrupt will keep interuppting until it is handle by the exception handler so there will be an exception loop.
