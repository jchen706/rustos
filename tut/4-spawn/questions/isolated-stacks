Two process sharing a stack means that there is a possiblility that each process can corrupt the stack by one processing push its execution information and the other processing popping off the other process's execution information. The process would crash very quickly because a process's data when it starts is pushed onto the stack. One process can overwrite another process's memory or overflow the stack. This can quickly cause process to crash.In order to have two processes running concurrently, a process can define its part of stack non-executable or writable by another process. So two process cannot overwrite or pop each other's part of the stack.
