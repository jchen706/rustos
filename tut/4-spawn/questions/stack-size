Process could increase the memory size by having a function call in the kernel to reset the top of the stack to a lower physical address to double the orginal memory space as long as stack does not overflow.

To do that we need the current memory size which is 2^20.

mov x0 #(2 << 20)

Then 

enlarge:

	add x1, x0, x0 //double the memory
	mov x0,x1

x0 now has the double memory capacity for allocation.
The kernel would have to copy the old stack to the new stack and set the pointer to the current pointer.

To copy the old stack we need to loop until the stack bottom of the old stack with the stack pointer. First store the stack pointer to a register.
