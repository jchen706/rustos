We do have to maintain the state of whether SIMD/FP is disable or not which we need a disable/enable register in the trapframe.
One way is to utilize one register to account for which SIMD/FP register are used. We only have to check 32 bits to see which registers to restore.
The FPEN field of CPACR_EL traps the instruction associated with SIMD/FP. If the value of this register is 0bX0, then the  SIMD/FP instructions 
can be trapped. The exception generated is Symdrome SimdFP.
