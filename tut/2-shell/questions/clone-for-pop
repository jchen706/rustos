T:Clone is required for pop because the StackVec pop returns the underlying value of T. We also are remove the value from 
the StackVec so we can't return a reference to it by lifetime. In Vec<T>, once pop, the Vec<T> 
implements the resize method for reallocating the memory which implements the Clone to pass the values. 
If the bound is removed, the cloned value will be drop within the scope of the drop function.
