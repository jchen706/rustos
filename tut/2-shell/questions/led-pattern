The led pattern that I choose is to blink each light one second at a time.
So one led will of Gpio 5 will blink for one second, then clear. 
After than Gpio 6 will blink for second and cleared. Then Gpio 13 will
blink for a second and clear. Gpio 19 will blink for second and clear for a second.
Lastly in the loop, Gpio 26 will blink for a second and clear for a second before 
Gpio 5 will blink again.
