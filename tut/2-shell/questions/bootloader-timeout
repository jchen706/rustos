In a Xmodem protocal that we used, we need the downloader to send a NAK and the uploader to receive the NAK and send a SOH. Between these acknowledgement, packets 
can get lost or SOH or NAK can also get lost in the protocal. So resending the current byte by the downloader or sender provides a safety net to 
make sure all packets arrived, and nothing is missing. Bytes can get lost through disconnection or bad connection or just a voltage shortage, so the transmitter 
will stall. In addition, if alot of bytes are sent, it takes time for the bytes to be processed and written and read, so there is also a propagation delay.
