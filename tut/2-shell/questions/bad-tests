 The -r enable or disable the XModem usage or just send the data in raw because it is more efficent
 to send just small amount of bytes in raw rather going through all the ackowledgments in xmodem protocol. 

XMODEM protocol expect the downloader to NAK the sender. If there is not a NAK to the sender, then the sender will
have to keep transmitting the NAK until a SOH is received. In test.sh, 
the input and output are checked which is similar to checksum of packets in Xmodem.
Xmodem expects a end of transmission, EOT from uploader, NAK form downloader, EOT from uploader,
ACK from downloader.
