Bound is required because the Rust only lets a initialize variable to live within
the scope of the function definition. If bound was not enforce the StackVec will still be used 
in the main scope of the program while the internal data T is dropped by the scope of the struct.
Rust does not allow variables to become null. Bounds check help prevent necessary values being 
dropped.
