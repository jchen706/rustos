Vec::push is based on a operation system support which allows the user not have
to track the memory. Vec will allocate memory on the heap. It is dynamically resized.
StackVec::push fails if all memory is already allocated, no memory left to allocate. The StackVec
has a constant size and does not resize because our current os does not support
internal malloc.
